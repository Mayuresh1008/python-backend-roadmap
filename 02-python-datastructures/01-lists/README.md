## 📌 Creating Lists

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
mixed = [1, "hello", 3.5, True]

print(fruits)
print(numbers)
print(mixed)
```

## 🔍 Indexing & Slicing

```python
print(fruits[0])      # First element
print(fruits[-1])     # Last element
print(fruits[1:])     # From index 1 to end
```
