QUEUES (FIFO - First In, First Out)
What is a Queue?
- A linear data structure where the first element added(enqueued) is the first to be removed(dequeued).
- Example : Line at a ticket counter -> the person who comes first, gets served first.

Operations:
1) Enqueue -> Add element at the rear.
2) Dequeue -> Remove element from the front.
3) Peek/Front -> See the first element without removing.
4) IsEmpty -> Check if queue is empty.
