# üß† Python: Scopes and Closures

---

## üîç Scope in Python

**Scope** defines where a variable can be accessed in your code. Python follows the **LEGB Rule**:

* **L**ocal
* **E**nclosing
* **G**lobal
* **B**uilt-in

### ‚úÖ Examples:

```python
# Global scope
username = "alex"

def func():
    # Local scope
    print(username)

print(username)
func()
```

```python
# Global, Enclosing, Local scope example
x = "global"

def outer():
    x = "enclosing"

    def inner():
        x = "local"
        print("Inner:", x)

    inner()
    print("Outer:", x)

outer()
print("Global:", x)
```

```python
# Using global keyword
count = 0

def increment():
    global count
    count += 1

increment()
print(count)  # Output: 1
```

## üîê Closures in Python

A **closure** is a function that remembers variables from its enclosing scope, even after the outer function has finished executing.

Closures occur when a nested function refers to a value defined in its outer function.

### ‚úÖ Simple Closure Example:

```python
def f1():
    x = 88

    def f2():
        print(x)

    return f2

myResult = f1()
myResult()  # Output: 88
```

### ‚úÖ Practical Closure Example:

```python
def code(num):
    def actual(x):
        return x**num
    return actual

f = code(2)
g = code(3)

print(f(3))  # 9
print(g(3))  # 27
```
